# Python Conventions

- Use Python 3.10+ syntax. Prefer type hints for function signatures and public APIs.
- Run tools in this order when applicable: formatter, linter, tests.
- Prefer `pathlib.Path` over `os.path` and f-strings over `str.format`.
- Organize code into small, testable functions; avoid deep nesting.
- Handle errors explicitly; avoid bare `except` clauses.
- Document functions with concise docstrings that describe purpose, params, returns, and errors.
- Avoid global state. Pass dependencies as parameters or use simple classes.
- Keep modules cohesive; one major responsibility per file.
