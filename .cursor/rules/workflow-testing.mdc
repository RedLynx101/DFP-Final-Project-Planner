# Workflow and Testing Guidance

- Prefer small, incremental commits with clear messages.
- Use virtual environments; pin dependencies in `requirements.txt` when code is added.
- Write tests for core logic. If no framework is set, start with `unittest`.
- Keep data files out of version control unless they are tiny and essential.
- Document how to run the project in a short `README.md` when code is added.
- If a decision impacts the rubric, cite the rubric section in commit messages.
