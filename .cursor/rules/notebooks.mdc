# Jupyter Notebook Guidance

- Keep notebooks lightweight: exploration, visualization, and reporting only.
- Move reusable logic into `.py` modules; import into notebooks.
- Restart kernel and run all before committing to ensure reproducibility.
- Clear unnecessary outputs and large data artifacts before saving.
- Use markdown cells to explain intent, not code mechanics.
- Prefer relative paths; avoid machine-specific absolute paths.
